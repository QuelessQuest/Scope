# Scope

Unofficial community Foundry VTT system for The microscope RPG.

## State of Development
Currently, very much in an alpha phase. Some base functionality is there, but a few bugs linger about.

## What is included?
This system makes no reference to the actual rules to microscope or how to play a session. 
You will need a copy of the microscope rules in order to take full advantage of this system.

What is provided is a way to create the cards and organize them within a Foundry scene.
Supports the dragging and dropping of the cards. Displays the links between the various cards
and updates the links as cards are moved/dropped.

## TODO List
* Re-enable Whetstone, if Whetstone receives an update to support Foundry 0.8+
  * Whetstone wil enable the custom setting of card colors, link colors, drop shadow and a whole host of goodies
* Provide better default Journal formats. Make it look less like something thrown together, which is currently is.
* There is some 'raw' code in place that needs cleaning and optimising.
* Better support for Legacies
* General appearance cleanup of the Journal tab
